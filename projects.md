## üìö Cool Repositories I've Discovered

### Machine Learning & AI

- **[scrapegraphai.com](https://scrapegraphai.com)** - AI-powered web scraping API that extracts structured data from websites using LLMs and natural language prompts. Features SmartScraper, SmartCrawler, and AgenticScraper for autonomous navigation without manual selector writing.

### Bioinformatics Tools

- **[MALISAM](http://prodata.swmed.edu/malisam/)** - Database of structurally analogous motifs in proteins from UT Southwestern. Features manually curated structure-based alignments for protein analogs (non-homologous proteins with similar structures). Essential for protein evolution studies and remote homology detection research.

- **[ProteinGym](https://proteingym.org/)** - Comprehensive benchmarking platform for protein mutation effect prediction featuring ~2.7M missense variants across 217 DMS assays and 2,525 clinical proteins. Enables standardized evaluation of ML models for predicting protein fitness and variant effects in both zero-shot and supervised settings.

- **[ESM](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm)** - Evolutionary Scale Models from EvolutionaryScale featuring ESM3 (generative AI for protein sequence, structure, and function reasoning) and ESM C (high-quality protein embeddings). Open-source models that enable protein design, structure prediction, and evolutionary analysis.

- **[EVO 2](https://github.com/ArcInstitute/evo2)** - State-of-the-art DNA language model from Arc Institute capable of modeling genome sequences up to 1M base pairs at single-nucleotide resolution. Trained on 8.8 trillion tokens, supports variant effect prediction, sequence generation, and genomic feature classification across all domains of life.

### Development Tools

- **[cosmograph.app](https://cosmograph.app/)** - Web-based GPU-accelerated graph visualization tool for large datasets and ML embeddings. Features interactive network analysis, community detection, temporal data exploration, and client-side processing. Available as both web app and JavaScript/React library for developers.

- **[modal.com](https://modal.com/)** - Serverless AI infrastructure platform with sub-second container starts and zero configuration. Python-first approach for AI inference, batch processing, and GPU-accelerated computing. Scales to hundreds of GPUs instantly with pay-per-second pricing and $30 monthly free credits.

- **[browserless.io](https://browserless.io)** - Browser automation platform offering Browser-as-a-Service (BaaS) with managed browser pools. Features advanced bot detection bypass, supports Puppeteer/Playwright scripts, REST APIs for PDF generation and screenshots, plus enterprise-grade scalability for web scraping and automation.

- **[free-for.dev](https://free-for.dev)** - Comprehensive community-maintained list of free-tier services and tools for developers. Curates SaaS, PaaS, IaaS offerings with genuine free tiers (not just trials) across cloud providers, APIs, and development tools. Essential resource for cost-conscious development.

- **[serena](https://github.com/oraios/serena)** - Coding agent toolkit that enhances AI-powered software development with semantic code retrieval and IDE-like tools. Supports multiple languages via LSP, integrates with Claude Code, and enables precise symbol-level code navigation and manipulation.

- **[neohtop](https://github.com/Abdenasser/neohtop)** - Modern cross-platform system monitoring desktop app built with Rust, Tauri, and Svelte. Features blazing-fast real-time process monitoring, beautiful UI with dark/light themes, advanced search/filtering, and process management capabilities.

- **[rybbit.io](https://rybbit.io)** - Open-source, privacy-friendly web analytics platform. GDPR/CCPA compliant with cookieless tracking, session replay, and real-time analytics. Great alternative to Google Analytics for privacy-conscious developers.

- **[vexa.ai](https://vexa.ai)** - Real-time meeting transcription API with 99-language support. Features invisible latency transcription, real-time translation, and AI bot integration for Google Meet and other platforms. Open-source approach to multilingual meeting enhancement.
